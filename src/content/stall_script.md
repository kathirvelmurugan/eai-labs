# YESCON Stall Script (Bold Contra Version)

## Concept
Use this when you have a founder's attention. Do not pitch. Diagnose.

## The Script

**1. The Hook (Calm, pause after saying this)**
> "Your best employee might be the reason your system is still broken."

**2. The Reframe (Soften immediately)**
> "Not because they are weak. Because they are too good."

**3. The Truth**
> "They keep delivering results despite poor inputs and unclear setup."

**4. The Consequence**
> "So the real system never gets fixed."

**5. The Offer**
> "We fix the setup that creates this dependency, not the person."

## Internal Cues
- **Look for**: Founders nodding about "one person holding it all together".
- **Avoid**: Blaming the employee. The employee is a hero; the system is the villain.
- **Goal**: Move from "people problem" to "system problem".
